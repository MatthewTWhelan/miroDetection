This folder includes all the software and data necessary for the MiRo detection algorithm. Although training has already been completed, retraining can be done by running the HOG_w_knn_svm_TRAIN.py script. All training data is stored in the folders MiRo_body and Negatives, so add training data here and retrain as necessary. Finally, to test, add some images into the Test_images folder, and run Miro_detection_TESTING.py, which will classify using SVM. Some images are included already as sample images.
